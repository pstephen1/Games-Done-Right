Purpose:

Runnin' Man is a miniature platformer that was created to study game loops and HTML Canvas. The colission detection of the game was probably
the hardest part to figure out, but I think that its current implementation is sufficient for this game.

Instructions:

Use the left and right arrow keys to move.
Press Space to jump.

Known issues:

There are currently no known issues with the game. It is a short run to the top.

Future releases:

More levels!
Sound effects and music as well.
