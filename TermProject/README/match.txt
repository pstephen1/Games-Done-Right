Instructions:

In order to play this game, simply click on a card. The card will be flipped. Once you click on a second card, the cards will be matched together.
If they match, you score a point! If they don't, then you gain a "miss." You will have two seconds to look at the cards before they're put back face down.
During the two seconds, you cannot select more cards.
The game continues until all cards are matched. 
To play again, simply refresh the page - The cards are randomized on load!

Purpose:

The purpose of this game is to practice the use of jQuery for the purpose of study. Rather than use text, I wanted to practice with images and manipulating their states (classes).

Issues:

At present there are no known problems with the game. 
This was also much more complicated than I thought it would be, so there may be issues that I have not come across.

Future releases:

In a future release I would like to add a reset button that reinitializes the game.
I would also like to animate the card flips.
